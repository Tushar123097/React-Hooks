# React-Hooks
There is two hooks first one is usestate and second one is useeffect
1: useState:
It is a way for React to remember a value for you.
Example: If you want to count how many times a button is clicked, useState helps you store and update that number.

2: useEffect:
It lets you run some code when something changes or when the page loads.
Example: If you want to show a message every time the count changes, useEffect helps you do that.
